## DevOps: The Monitoring Stage

The monitoring stage is essential for gaining insights into the performance and health of your applications and infrastructure. In a DevOps environment, monitoring is automated and proactive, allowing you to identify and resolve issues before they impact users.

### Key Activities in the Monitoring Stage:

*   **Metrics Collection:** Collect key metrics about your applications and infrastructure, such as CPU usage, memory usage, response time, and error rates.
*   **Log Aggregation:** Aggregate logs from different sources into a central location for analysis.
*   **Real-time Dashboards:** Create real-time dashboards to visualize key metrics and identify trends.
*   **Alerting:** Set up alerts to notify you of critical events or performance degradation.
*   **Root Cause Analysis:** Investigate and identify the root cause of incidents to prevent them from recurring.

By implementing a comprehensive monitoring strategy, you can improve the reliability and performance of your applications, reduce downtime, and enhance the user experience.
