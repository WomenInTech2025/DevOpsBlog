## DevOps: The Coding Stage

The coding stage is where the software development actually happens. In a DevOps environment, this stage emphasizes collaboration, automation, and continuous integration.

### Key Activities in the Coding Stage:

*   **Version Control:** Use a version control system (e.g., Git) to track changes to your code and enable collaboration among developers.
*   **Code Reviews:** Conduct regular code reviews to ensure code quality and identify potential bugs.
*   **Automated Testing:** Implement automated tests to verify the functionality of your code and prevent regressions.
*   **Continuous Integration:** Integrate code changes frequently and automatically build and test the software.
*   **Infrastructure as Code:** Manage your infrastructure using code, allowing you to automate the provisioning and configuration of your environments.

By embracing these practices, you can accelerate the development process, improve code quality, and reduce the risk of errors.
