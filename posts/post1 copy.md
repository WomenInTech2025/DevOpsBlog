## DevOps: The Building Stage

The building stage is where the code is compiled, packaged, and prepared for deployment. In a DevOps environment, this stage is highly automated and relies on continuous integration practices.

### Key Activities in the Building Stage:

*   **Compilation:** Compile the source code into executable binaries or other deployable artifacts.
*   **Packaging:** Package the compiled code and its dependencies into a deployable package (e.g., a Docker image).
*   **Automated Testing:** Run automated tests to verify the functionality and quality of the build.
*   **Artifact Repository:** Store the built artifacts in an artifact repository (e.g., Nexus or Artifactory).
*   **Versioning:** Assign a unique version number to each build to track changes and facilitate rollbacks.

By automating the building stage, you can ensure consistent and reliable builds, reduce the risk of errors, and accelerate the deployment process.
